# Disporty Platform: Information Architecture & User Flows

## Introduction

This document outlines the information architecture for the Disporty platform's user-facing web application. This architecture focuses on the white-labeled tournament management platform that players and teams interact with, not the administrative backend used by organizations to configure their branded instances.

The platform serves football gaming communities by providing comprehensive tournament management, player development tracking, team coordination, and social engagement features. The architecture is organized as interconnected user flows, where each flow represents a collection of screens that enable users to accomplish specific tasks within the gaming ecosystem.
